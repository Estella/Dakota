I woke up in the morning
I got up to my terminal
And I typed this three letter command
I typed 'irc'
Which is normally
A nice place to chat about

But today
'irc' has insulted me
Insulted me many times
I could write a song about it
I am writing a song about abuse

IRC bullying is very very real
Very very real
And very very painful
IRC bullying is one of the main reasons
I cuss out loud
To my parents
... I cuss out loud
To my parents...

Have you ever heard of AsterIRC
It is a very small place
But it is sure to please
With nice chats and low levels of oper 'buse
It's really a nice place to chat...

Have you ever heard of Quakenet?
The worst server in the world
The IRC chats are about as insane
As you could make them
So i don't know why
I am singing this little song...

I might need to autotune
I'm that bad a singer
But then again
That happens to all teenagers
We're all bad singers
Because we're still children
But I don't know what to say next...
I don't know why I am even alive...
