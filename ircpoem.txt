Charybdis song
by j4jackj

Charybdis... Charybdis... where art thou Charybdis?
Oh there you are.
...
   To the tune of the chorus of 'We didn't start the fire' by Unknown Artist :P
I want to mod Charybdis
Make it suitable for EmiNET
I want to improve Charybdis
Make it suitable for the ninety per cent

I know it's not that easy
But I know what I need to make it all work
I know the ninety percent
Want Unreal or InspIRCd...

That's what I'm trying to do
Bring Charybdis up to feature parity
At least as far as the
User should be concerned about their IRCs
